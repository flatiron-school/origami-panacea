# Origami Panacea

Your grandpa is in the insane asylum, and his doctors tell you that he is going to die unless you make him the most amazing of origami. The only problem is you don't know what your grandpa will find amaizing. 

## Objectives
* Cut a piece of paper into a square

  * That was a really good effort, and your doctors are encouraged, but it wasn't enough. You'll need to step it up 

* Make an origami ballon

  * Your grandpa really responded to that ballon, but is still a little loopy, and the doctors want to try something a little more agressive. 

Dig deep and make the most epic of origami in a last ditch effort to save your grandpa

* Make an origami crane

  * That worked!! Your grandpa snaps out of it, shaves, combs his hair with some Brylcreem, and you both get ice cream! 

Nice work!
